    "# Data Preparation for POMMES\n",
    "This notebook contains the major routines used to prepare and provide input data for the fundamental power market model _POMMES_ <br>(<b>Po</b>wer <b>M</b>arket <b>M</b>odel <b>E</b>nergy and re<b>S</b>ources).\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides input data for (oemof.solph components used for modeling given in brackets)\n",
    "* conventional power plants (Transformers)\n",
    "* interconnectors (Transformers; formerly Links)\n",
    "* storages (GenericStorages)\n",
    "* commodity sources (Sources)\n",
    "* renewable generators (Sources / Transformers)\n",
    "* power demand (Sinks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "* A `pommesdispatch` data set for any year between 2017 and 2030 can be created.\n",
    "* Also, a `pommesinvest` data set is created, spanning the time horizon from 2020 to 2050.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-related information:\n",
    "* For future years, power plant commissionings and decommissionings are taken into account and RES are expanded by a given pathway.\n",
    "* Note that so far, we have included **time series information only for 2017**. For any other year, 2017 time series are used and simply reindexed. To have a comparable simulation year with 8760 hours, for leap years, the last day is simply neglected.\n",
    "* Also, UTC time stamps are used thus ignoring time shift.\n",

    "Overview on the document:\n",
    "> **Outline:** The correspondend elements, named components, used in the framework [oemof.solph](https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph) determine the outline of the given notebook.\n",
    "> _NOTE: It is recommended to run the notebook sequentially since variables declared earlier may be needed later on, even in later sections._\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Raw data sources:** The raw data is taken from different sources, mostly [OPSD](https://open-power-system-data.org/) and [ENTSO-E](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/). The major sources and assumptions are documented for the respective power system elements (components) in the following. For power plant projections, data from the lastest approved network development plan for electricity for Germany [NEP Strom 2030 as of 2019](https://www.netzentwicklungsplan.de/de/netzentwicklungsplaene/netzentwicklungsplan-2030-2019) as well as data from the [TYNDP 2018](https://tyndp.entsoe.eu/maps-data) of ENTSO-E for are used.<br>\n",
    "An overview on the data licensing information can be found in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tasks:** Besides extraction, cleaning and combination of data from the sources and assumptions, significant parts of the notebooks are routines for transferring the data to a data format that can be handled by the framework [oemof.solph](https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph) which serves as a basis for the model _POMMES_.\n",

In each year, around 100/x% of the overall capacity to be decommissioned is actually decommissioned, whereby only entire blocks or plants are decommissioned.

    "* In order to reflect (market-based) power plant inflexibilities, gradients have been reduced to minimum observable ones of *power plant fleets*.\n",
    "* Since for deriving minimum load profiles, data for *individual* power plants has been used, it may be the case that a power plant is assigned a gradient that is below the maximum gradient required by its minimum load profile.\n",
    "* This would lead to an infeasible model configuration. Therefore, the gradient is adjusted here to at least equal the maximum gradient of the minimum load profile.\n",
    "* Gradients therefore are defined as time series and only the values below the maximum gradient of the minimum load profile are increased.\n",
    "* Gradient values are assigne for plants occuring in the min loads time series data sets for district heating resp. industrial power pants first.\n",
    "* Then, gradient values for the remaining district heating resp. industrial power plants based on fuels / countries.\n",
    "* In the last step, gradient values are compared with minimum load time series and increased wherever they are below the minimum load time series, also including a small margin for numerical reasons."

So their compensation is\n",

    "* In order not to provoke situations with a loss of load (LOL), the idea is to introduce backup power plants for levelling out the system balance for future target years.\n",
    "* The scheme of the capacity balance (sheet) is used here. The latest TSO estimations covering 2018-2022 are used as a rough guideline. The scenario with a coal phase out is used. It shows that for 2021 with around 72 GW of installed capacity not including network reserve and security backup (of coal power plants), the remaining margin of 2 GW is small but sufficient. Hence, it is assumed that installed capacity has to add up to 72 GW in order to meet the peak demand.\n",
    "* Accordignly, the difference between the overall capacity given here for 2030 (roughly 57 GW + 80% of phes and 28% of ROR capacities, 60% of biomass capacities and 1% of wind capacities) and the needed 72 GW is filled up with gas power plants.\n",
    "* The lacking capacity is evenly distributed between gas turbines and CCGT power plants.\n",
